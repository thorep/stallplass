# CLAUDE_SUMMARY.md

## Session Summary - 2025-08-18

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed Forum Post Creation Issue**
   - Added comprehensive logging to forum post creation flow
   - Added logging to API endpoint (`/api/forum/posts/route.ts`)
   - Added logging to forum service layer (`forum-service.ts`)
   - Added logging to React Query hook (`useForum.ts`)
   - Improved error handling to properly parse JSON error responses

2. **Updated CLAUDE.md**
   - Added instruction about periodically updating CLAUDE_SUMMARY.md
   - This helps maintain context across different Claude sessions

### Technical Changes
- **Logging added with prefixes:**
  - `[FORUM]` - API route level logging
  - `[FORUM SERVICE]` - Service layer/database operations
  - `[FORUM HOOK]` - Frontend React Query hook logging

- **Key files modified:**
  - `/src/app/api/forum/posts/route.ts` - Added detailed request/response logging
  - `/src/services/forum/forum-service.ts` - Added category validation and creation logging
  - `/src/hooks/useForum.ts` - Improved error parsing and request logging

### Issue Identified and Fixed
User reported: "jeg kan svare på tråder men jeg kan ikke opprette en ny tråd" (can reply to threads but cannot create new threads)

**Root cause found:** CategoryId was not being sent with the request
- URL had `?category=test` but categoryId was undefined in request
- The form was hiding the category selector but not properly passing the categoryId

### Fixes Applied
1. Fixed NewThreadPage to properly pass selectedCategoryId to ThreadForm
2. Added comprehensive logging throughout the forum creation flow
3. Created test category in database (slug: "test", id: "c8619b75-57dd-4bea-bf93-e282845f7206")
4. Fixed category lookup to match slug from URL parameter

### Current Status - RESOLVED ✅
- Forum thread creation now works
- Category selector is always visible to ensure categoryId is sent
- Added proper loading states to prevent double-submission:
  - Loading overlay with spinner and text
  - Form becomes disabled and semi-transparent during submission
  - Button shows loading spinner
  - Early return prevents duplicate submissions

### Improvements Made
1. **Loading State**: Added comprehensive loading indicators
   - Loading overlay with CircularProgress and text
   - Form opacity reduced and pointer-events disabled
   - Button disabled with loading spinner
   - Prevents double-clicks with early return check

2. **Category Selection**: Made category selector always visible
   - Ensures user can always select a category
   - Prevents issues with pre-selected categories not being sent

### Known Issues
- Pre-selecting category from URL parameter needs more work (timing issue with category loading)
- Could be improved to auto-select category when available
