Based on research of current 2025 trends for engaging marketplace websites, here are recommendations to make Stallplass feel more personal and build stronger community connections.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Issues Identified

The site currently feels very functional but lacks the emotional connection that builds trust in a marketplace. The reviews are disabled, and there's limited storytelling or community features.

## ðŸ“‹ Actionable Recommendations

### 1. **Add Success Stories & User Testimonials**
- Create a dedicated "Suksesshistorier" section featuring real stable owners and horse owners who found each other through your platform
- Include photos, quotes, and brief stories about their experience

- **User Profiles**: Allow users to add photos, bio, riding experience

### 5. **Social Proof & Trust Building**
- Re-enable the review system (it's currently disabled)
- **Statistics that matter**: "Over 500 successful matches made", "200+ happy stables"
- **Trust badges**: Verified stable owners, safety certifications
- **Recent activity feed**: "Sarah just found a stable in Oslo" (with permission)

### 6. **Personalized Experience**
- **Welcome messages**: Personalized greetings based on user type (stable owner vs horse owner)
- **Saved searches**: Let users save and get alerts for their preferred criteria
- **Recommended matches**: "Stables similar to ones you've viewed"
